The Sälen NX is at once familiar and strikingly bold, vintage-and-futuristic, yesterday-and-tomorrow. Sonically and tactile response-wise, the Sälen NX Deluxe model will provide nice warmth and roundness due to the chambered body and make the bridge pickup less piercing on the high notes so there’s no need to roll back the tone knob. The Sälen NX Deluxe has a slightly warmer and more open sound than the Sälen NX Classic due to the chambered body but otherwise share similar sonic characteristics.",

Featuring a chambered Basswood body with Maple top and Ziricote veneer, Maple neck with Birdseye Maple fretboard with the special “Hen” inlay on the first fret, custom wood knobs, angled Lundgren M8 humbuckers with a push-pull coil tap tone knob, this instrument stands out from the crowd aesthetically, conceptually, and sonically. From pulverizing metal riffs to searing leads and sparkling clean single-coil rhythm to warm fat-bodied humbucker tones, the Boden 8 Richard Henshall can pummel and scream or purr while responding with uncompromising accuracy and sensitivity to your most aggressive pick attack or the most subtle nuances of your playing.",
