The Sälen NX is at once familiar and strikingly bold, vintage-and-futuristic, yesterday-and-tomorrow. Sonically and tactile response-wise, the Sälen NX Deluxe model will provide nice warmth and roundness due to the chambered body and make the bridge pickup less piercing on the high notes so there’s no need to roll back the tone knob. The Sälen NX Deluxe has a slightly warmer and more open sound than the Sälen NX Classic due to the chambered body but otherwise share similar sonic characteristics.",
